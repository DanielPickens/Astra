# Features of astra

By using `astra`, application developers can develop, test, debug, and deploy microservices based applications on Kubernetes without having a deep understanding of the platform.


- Thanks to a library of [predefined Devfile stacks](https://registry.devfile.io/viewer) you don't have to worry about setting up your build pipelines.
- `astra` allows you easily develop application while it is running on Kubernetes cluster. 


Take a look at the "Using astra" documentation for in-depth guides on doing advanced commands with `astra`.

For a quick high level summary of the features we are planning to add, take a look at astra's [milestones on GitHub](https://github\.com/danielpickens/astra/milestones).
