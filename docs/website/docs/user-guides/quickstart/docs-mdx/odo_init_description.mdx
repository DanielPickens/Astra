Now we'll initialize your application by creating a `devfile.yaml` to be deployed.

`astra` handles this automatically with the `astra init` command by autodetecting your source code and downloading the appropriate Devfile.

**Note:** If you skipped *Step 0*, select a "starter project" when running `astra init`.

<p>Let's run <code>astra init</code> and select <span>{props.framework}</span>:</p>

<span>{props.instruction}</span>

```console
astra init
```

If you skipped Step 0 and selected "starter project", your output will be slightly different.
